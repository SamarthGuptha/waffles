                Stephen Curry didn't just play basketball; he rewrote the manual. Before 2012, the 3 pointer was a tool; after Curry, it became the primary weapon. His ability to shoot off the dribble from <span class="highlighter">Logo Range</span> forced defenses to extend further than ever before in NBA history. This "gravity" opened up the floor for his teammates, creating the dynasty known as the Golden State Warriors. His 2016 season remains the only unanimous MVP selection in league history, a testament to a level of dominance that transcended simple statistics.
